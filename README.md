- ðŸŒ± Feeling most comfortable with React-Environment and getting familiar with TypeScript and GraphQL.

- ðŸŽ§ I started my career in the night-live of Amsterdam where got to meet all sorts of interesting people. I really developed my music production skills over the years and did lots of studio work.

- ðŸŽ¢ After doing some online courses I got hooked pretty quickly and decided to further develop my skills by joining the codaisseur bootcamp, this was probably one of the best decisions in my life!

- ðŸŒ± With a good foundation of skills to build upon I think i'm ready for the next step and to keep growing as a developer!
